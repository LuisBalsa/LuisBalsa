The Minishell project is a command-line shell program designed to replicate basic Unix shell functionality. It supports features such as command execution, history management, input/output redirection, piping, and handling of environment variables.

#### Key Features
- Command execution logic using a binary tree structure.
- Support for input/output redirection and piping.
- Implementation of built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- Handling of signals such as Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, and Ctrl-\ in interactive mode.

#### Implementation Details
The Minishell project utilizes a binary tree data structure to manage the execution of commands and associated operations. The command parsing process involves tokenization, parsing pipelines, parsing commands, handling input/output redirection, and logical operators.

#### Project Achievements
The Minishell project achieved the maximum score of 125, demonstrating the successful implementation of all required features and meeting project objectives.
